I would like to thank my parents, Juli and William Wright, and my stepmother, Ellen Fox, for working hard to raise me well and provide me with all the opportunities I could hope for.  I also have to thank my wonderful wife, Allison Wootan.  We have been a huge part of each others' lives for almost a decade now, and I can't imagine being here without her.  Without the love and support of these people I certainly would not have made it to where I am today.

I would also like to thank Boris Blinov for his support since the first day I arrived at the University of Washington.  He's given me the opportunity to take apart everything in our lab, and I've even managed to put most of it back together.  I can't imagine working in any other kind of lab, and I've greatly enjoyed it and learned so much from him.

I've been fortunate to work with a great team of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  In particular, I learned a huge fraction of what I know about ion trapping by talking with fellow graduate students Thomas Noel and Matt Hoffman.  It's been great working closely with Tomasz Sakrejda these past few years and seeing Carolyn Auchter, Spencer Williams, and CK Chou around the lab.  I've also enjoyed working with our postdocs Richard Graham and Zichao Zhou.  There have also been many undergraduates who have helped build so much of the infrastructure I use everyday including Matthew Bohman, Wen Lin Tan, Sarah Innes-Gold, Sean Nelson, and many others.
