abstract = {We report on the demonstration of ion-photon entanglement and Bell inequality violation in a system of trapped Ba138$+$ ions. Entanglement between the Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of a single Ba138$+$ ion and the polarization state of a single 493\&\#xA0;nm photon emitted by the ion with a fidelity of 0.84\&\#xB1;0.01 was achieved, along with a Bell signal of 2.3, exceeding the classical limit of 2 by more than eight standard deviations. This system is a promising candidate for a loophole-free Bell inequality violation test using long-range ion\&\#x2013;ion entanglement as the wavelengths of the transitions of Ba138$+$ are in the visible region and thus suitable for long-range transmission over fiber optic cable.},

abstract = {Trapped, laser-cooled atoms and ions produce intense fluorescence of the order 107~108 photons per second. Detection of this fluorescence enables efficient measurement of the quantum state of qubits based on trapped atoms. It is desirable to collect a large fraction of the photons to make the detection faster and more reliable. Additionally, efficient fluorescence collection can improve the speed and fidelity of remote ion entanglement and quantum gates. Refractive and reflective optics, and optical cavities have all been used to collect the trapped ion fluorescence with up to about 10\% efficiency. Here we show a novel ion trap design that incorporates a metallic spherical mirror as the integral part of the trap itself, being its RF electrode. The mirror geometry enables up to 35\% solid angle collection of trapped ion fluorescence. The movable central pin electrode of this trap allows precise placement of the ion at the focus of the reflector. We characterize the performance of the mirror, and measure 25\% collection efficiency, likely limited by the imperfections of the mirror surface. We also study the properties of the images of single ions formed by the spherical mirror and apply aberration correction with an aspherical element placed outside the vacuum system. Owing to the simplicity of its design, this trap structure can be adapted for microfabrication and integration into more complex trap architectures.},

	abstract ={The performance of superconducting qubits has improved by several orders of magnitude in the past decade. These circuits benefit from the robustness of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, and at present they have not encountered any hard physical limits. However, building an error-corrected information processor with many such qubits will require solving specific architecture problems that constitute a new field of research. For the first time, physicists will have to master quantum error correction to design and operate complex active systems that are dissipative in nature, yet remain coherent indefinitely. We offer a view on some directions for the field and speculate on its future.},

	    abstract = { Experimental and theoretical progress toward quantum computation with spins in quantum dots (QDs) is reviewed, with particular focus on QDs formed in GaAs heterostructures, on nanowire-based QDs, and on self-assembled QDs. We report on a remarkable evolution of the field, where decoherence—one of the main challenges for realizing quantum computers—no longer seems to be the stumbling block it had originally been considered. General concepts, relevant quantities, and basic requirements for spin-based quantum computing are explained; opportunities and challenges of spin-orbit interaction and nuclear spins are reviewed. We discuss recent achievements, present current theoretical proposals, and make several suggestions for further experiments. }
