abstract = {We report on the demonstration of ion-photon entanglement and Bell inequality violation in a system of trapped Ba138$+$ ions. Entanglement between the Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of a single Ba138$+$ ion and the polarization state of a single 493\&\#xA0;nm photon emitted by the ion with a fidelity of 0.84\&\#xB1;0.01 was achieved, along with a Bell signal of 2.3, exceeding the classical limit of 2 by more than eight standard deviations. This system is a promising candidate for a loophole-free Bell inequality violation test using long-range ion\&\#x2013;ion entanglement as the wavelengths of the transitions of Ba138$+$ are in the visible region and thus suitable for long-range transmission over fiber optic cable.},

abstract = {Trapped, laser-cooled atoms and ions produce intense fluorescence of the order 107~108 photons per second. Detection of this fluorescence enables efficient measurement of the quantum state of qubits based on trapped atoms. It is desirable to collect a large fraction of the photons to make the detection faster and more reliable. Additionally, efficient fluorescence collection can improve the speed and fidelity of remote ion entanglement and quantum gates. Refractive and reflective optics, and optical cavities have all been used to collect the trapped ion fluorescence with up to about 10\% efficiency. Here we show a novel ion trap design that incorporates a metallic spherical mirror as the integral part of the trap itself, being its RF electrode. The mirror geometry enables up to 35\% solid angle collection of trapped ion fluorescence. The movable central pin electrode of this trap allows precise placement of the ion at the focus of the reflector. We characterize the performance of the mirror, and measure 25\% collection efficiency, likely limited by the imperfections of the mirror surface. We also study the properties of the images of single ions formed by the spherical mirror and apply aberration correction with an aspherical element placed outside the vacuum system. Owing to the simplicity of its design, this trap structure can be adapted for microfabrication and integration into more complex trap architectures.},

Low energy spin-dependent charged particle collisions which have been studied include electron-atom spin exchange, spin-dependent electron-atom elastic collisions, spin-dependent excitation of atoms by polarized electrons, and spin-dependent electron transfer. Cross sections for electron recombination with molecules have been measured, as were the rate coefficients for ion-molecule reactions at temperatures between 11 K and 60 K. The rate coefficients or cross sections for electron transfer from atoms or molecules to atomic ions with charge states as high as 10 + , and energies in the eV range or below, have been obtained. The mean lifetimes of atomic and molecular ion states, with lifetimes ranging from 10−9s to tens of seconds, decaying by E1, intercombination E1, 2E1, \{M1\} and \{E2\} transitions, have been measured. The experimental data are presented in tabular form to simplify retrieval. The operation of the ion traps, and certain properties of the ion motion in the traps, are discussed, particularly from the point of view of the storage of ion numbers typically used in collisional research. The background and motivation for individual measurements, as well as salient features of the experimental technique, are also presented. "

By amplitude pulse shaping and compensation of ac-Stark shifts we achieve a fast gate operation without compromising the error rate. Subjecting different input states to concatenations of up to 21 individual gate operations reveals Bell state fidelities above 0.80. In principle, the entangling gate does not require ground state cooling of the ions as long as the Lamb–Dicke criterion is fulfilled. We present the first experimental evidence for this claim and create Bell states with a fidelity of 0.974(1) for ions in a thermal state of motion with a mean phonon number of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/11/2/023002/nj294699ieqn1.gif] {\bar{n}=20(2)} in the mode coupling to the ions' internal states.}

              abstract={We theoretically and experimentally examine the effects of anharmonic terms in the trapping potential for linear chains of trapped ions. We concentrate on two different effects that become significant at different levels of anharmonicity. The first is a modification of the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes of the ions' normal modes of vibration for multi-ion crystals, resulting from each ion experiencing a different curvature in the potential. In the second effect, which occurs with increased anharmonicity or higher excitation amplitude, amplitude-dependent shifts of the normal-mode frequencies become important. We evaluate normal-mode frequency and amplitude shifts, and comment on the implications for quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. Since the ratio of the anharmonic to harmonic terms typically increases as the ion?electrode distance decreases, anharmonic effects will become more significant as ion trap sizes are reduced. To avoid unwanted problems, anharmonicities should therefore be taken into account at the design stage of trap development.}

The trap is fabricated with very large scalable integration techniques which are compatible with scaling to a large quantum information processor. The shape of the radio-frequency electrodes is optimized with a genetic algorithm to reduce axial pseudopotential barriers and minimize ion heating during transport. Seventy-eight independent dc control electrodes enable fine control of the trapping potentials. We demonstrate reliable ion transport between junction legs and determine the rate of ion loss due to transport. Doppler-cooled ions survive more than 10 5 round-trip transits between junction legs without loss and more than 65 consecutive round trips without laser cooling.}

  abstract={We report heating rate measurements in a microfabricated gold-on-sapphire surface electrode ion trap with a trapping height of approximately 240 μm. Using the Doppler recooling method, we characterize the trap heating rates over an extended region of the trap. The noise spectral density of the trap falls in the range of noise spectra reported in ion traps at room temperature. We find that during the first months of operation, the heating rates increase by approximately one order of magnitude. The increase in heating rates is largest in the ion-loading region of the trap, providing a strong hint that surface contamination plays a major role for excessive heating rates. We discuss data found in the literature and the possible relation of anomalous heating to sources of noise and dissipation in other systems, namely impurity atoms adsorbed onto metal surfaces and amorphous dielectrics.}

For the first time to our knowledge, this method provides important information on the stability of mode locking above the Q-switched mode-locking threshold. It is applicable to lasers that are mode locked with slow-saturable absorbers. The results helped to explain the cause of unexpectedly low Q-switching thresholds in two cases. Also we obtain some useful spectroscopic information.},
