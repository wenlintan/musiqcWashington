The two ion species that were chosen to load into these traps as part of our computer architecture were barium and ytterbium.  These elements have several advantages for building a quantum computer using our architecture which will be discussed in this chapter.  Ytterbium will be used to implement the actual quantum computation, while barium will be used to generate remotely entangled ion pairs between ion traps and cool both species.

\section{Ionization}
\label{sec:ionization}

Before any of the trapping technology discussed in the previous section will work we need a source of ions. The atoms to be ionized are generated by heating a small alumina oven inside the vacuum chamber.  The oven is loaded with small pieces cut from a barium or ytterbium sample before the chamber is sealed.  It is wrapped with small diameter tungsten wire which is then connected to a vacuum feedthrough.  By running currents between 1-2~A (depending on the length of the wire and its contact with the oven) the oven can be heated to a sufficient temperature to emit a usable flux of the neutral atom.  The flux from the oven is difficult to measure directly, but very reasonable trapping rates of a few ions per minute can be achieved with these currents.  Ionization is accomplished by applying lasers energetic enough to strip the outer electron from the atom, often using intermediate states of the neutral atom to provide isotope selectivity or increase the wavelength of the necessary beams.

Barium is an alkaline earth metal which makes the atomic structure of its ion easy to analyze.  The energy structure can be almost entirely understood by considering the single remaining valence electron (once the second valence electron is removed by ionization) interacting with the nucleus electrically shielded by the remaining electrons.  It has two low energy D orbital angular momentum states with very long lifetimes.

\end{figure}
The spectrum of neutral barium provides many different possibilities for ionization schemes as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:neutralba}.  Originally, we directly ionized with a xenon-mercury arc lamp.  This method is not isotope selective and the lamp is generally very difficult to focus.  We then switched to use a two laser scheme, first driving a transition from the 6s$^2$ ground state to a 6s6p $^3$P$_1$ excited state and then ionizing using a 337~nm nitrogen laser.  The first transition, accomplished using a single mode laser diode at approximately 791~nm, provides isotope selectivity.  In addition, both transitions are driven by lasers that can be reasonably focused near the trapping location.  

The 791~nm laser is stabilized using a side-of-the-fringe locking circuit to a low finesse optical cavity.  This circuit subtracts a constant value from the voltage output of a transimpedance amplifier connected to a photodiode behind the optical cavity.  This voltage provides an error signal that when fed back to the piezoelectric element in the ECDL with a PID controller will stabilize the frequency of the laser to a frequency on the side of the cavity line shape.  The cavity itself is temperature stabilized with another PID controller feeding back a temperature signal from a thermistor onto the current through a resistive heater using a MOSFET in the linear regime.  We observe short term frequency stability of a 1-3~MHz and long term stability of 10-20~MHz most likely due to residual variation in temperature and uncontrolled changes in atmospheric pressure.

This method of ionization has been very successful for a long time.  The only downside is that it still uses a fairly energetic beam in the 337~nm nitrogen laser.  This laser is energetic enough to easily ionize material deposited on the trap surfaces nearby which can create stray, uncontrolled electric fields that perturb the position of the ion.  This ionization becomes increasing problematic for wavelengths below 400~nm \cite{Harter:14}.  In macroscopic Paul traps, this issue has never caused any serious problems because the trap surfaces are several hundred microns from the trapping location and the ionization lasers can be well focused between these surfaces.  When working with chip traps, the trapping region is only separated from the nearest surface by 50-80~microns, and this charging can be a more serious issue.

After some initial difficulties trapping in surface traps, we switched to a different ionization scheme that uses only longer wavelength lasers.  The initial step is still the transition driven by the 791~nm laser, but then we instead drive a second intermediate transition to the 6p$^2$ $^3$P$_1$ state using a 450~nm ECDL.  From this excited state the 791~nm or any other laser provides sufficient energy to complete the ionization.

Ytterbium is a lanthanoid and has 14 more protons and electrons than barium.  These additional electrons are often bound in the 4f subshell and again there is a single valence electron in the 6s subshell that is easy to analyze.  There is the additional complication that one of the electrons from the 4f subshell can sometimes be excited to higher energy subshells giving rise to some addtional energy levels with an inner shell vacency.  For the most part these levels do not cause any problems, and operations can be as simple as with barium.

Currently we ionize ytterbium using a two-step isotope-selective process.  The neutral atom is addressed with a 399~nm laser that drives a transition from the ground state to 4f$^{14}$ $^1$S 6s6p $^1$P singlet state which provides isotope selectivity (see Figure~\ref{fig:neutralyb}).  We then ionize using the same nitrogen pulse laser that can be used to ionize barium.  Once we have set up our ytterbium cooling lasers, the 369~nm cooling beam will be a more efficient ionization path from the intermediate state.

When the atoms are ionized they are travelling in a hot thermal beam, and then suddenly they are affected by the trapping fields.  The depth of the trap is approximately 3~eV which corresponds to a temperature of ... .  Therefore only a small fraction of the thermal flux can actually be trapped at all.  Those ions that are confined need to be cooled to a much lower temperature in order to be well localized so that other operations can be performed on them.

\section{Doppler Cooling}
\label{sec:cooling}

This initial cooling can be accomplished by a technique called laser Doppler cooling.  A strong transition in the ion is addressed by a laser detuned to a frequency slightly lower than the center of the transition.  Cooling is then accomplished because of the effect of the Doppler shift because of the ions motion.  When the ion is moving towards the source of the laser, the ion sees an increased laser frequency which is closer to the center of the resonance.  Therefore the ion scatters more flourescence when it is moving towards the laser than when it is moving away from it.

The rate at which an ion scatters photons from a source can be found as
\begin{equation}
r_{scatter} = \frac{\Gamma}{2} \frac{s}{1 + s + \frac{4 \delta^2}{\Gamma^2}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta$ is the linewidth of the atomic transition, $s$ is the saturation parameter, and $\delta$ is the frequency detuning between the source and the center of the atomic transition.  Each photon scattering event also transfers the momentum from the photon to the ions motion.  Therefore the scatter rate can be rewritten as a force on the ion
\begin{equation}
F_\mathrm{scatter} = \hbar k r_\mathrm{scatter} = \hbar k \frac{\Gamma}{2} \frac{s}{1 + s + \frac{4 \delta^2}{\Gamma^2}}
\end{equation}
where $k = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi}$ is the photon wavenumber.

The Doppler shift affects this force by causing an additional frequency shift on the detuning.  The detuning $\delta$ can be rewritten for small ion velocities as $\delta - k v_{ion}$, where $v_{ion}$ is the velocity of the ion with respect to the laser. Cooling can be achived by choosing these parameters such that the ion experience a force of the form $F = -\gamma v_{ion}$ that acts in opposition to its velocity.  For small velocities the scatter force has the form
\begin{eqnarray}
	F_\mathrm{scatter,doppler} &\approx& F_\mathrm{scatter} + k v_\mathrm{ion} \frac{\partial F_\mathrm{scatter}}{\partial \delta} \\
	&=& F_\mathrm{scatter} \left( 1 - \frac{ 8 k \delta / \Gamma^2 }{ 1 + s + \frac{4 \delta^2}{\Gamma^2} } v_\mathrm{ion} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
where we can identify the term multiplying v$_\mathrm{ion}$ as the damping force coefficient.

The minimum temperature that can be reached by Doppler cooling is set by the random impulses the ion feels when it emits photons that it has absorbed.  Although these photons are randomly directed and average to no net contribution to the momentum, the ions temperature is still affected by them.  The resulting calculation is easiest to consider from an energy standpoint.  Balancing the cooling rate of the lasers and the heating rate from these fluctuations, the minimum energy can be found to be
\begin{equation}
	E_i = \hbar \left( 1 + \frac{f_\mathrm{scatter}}{f_\mathrm{absorb}} \right) \frac{ (\Gamma / 2)^2 + \delta^2 }{8 \delta} \mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
where $f_\mathrm{scatter}$ is the probability for the ion to scatter a photon in the $\hat{x}_i$ direction and $f_\mathrm{absorb}$ is the component of the Doppler cooling beam parallel to the $\hat{x}_i$ direction.

	\label{fig:doppler}
\end{figure}

Doppler cooling Barium involves using two lasers.  The 493~nm transition is chosen to be the transition to actually cool the ion.  Unfortunately, there are two possible decay paths from the 6P$_{1/2}$ state that the 493~nm laser excites.  The ion can decay directly back to the 6S$_{1/2}$ ground state from which the 493~nm transition may be driven again to continue cooling, but it may also decay to the long-lived 5D$_{3/2}$ state.  Since the lifetime of this state is $\approx$ 30~s it is necessary to use a second laser to depopulate this state in order to scatter enough 493~nm photons to cool the ion.

The 650~nm laser is provided by an external cavity laser diode directly providing apprxomiately 7~mW of optical power, but there were no avialable 493~nm diodes at the times the setup was designed.  Instead we have a 986~nm ECDL that produces approximately 150~mW of optical power.  The 986~nm light is sent through an AOM and the first order diffracted beam is sent through a periodically-poled lithium niobate doubling crystal to produce 493~nm light.  Since this switching is performed in the infrared light the isolation is doubled in the blue light sent to the ion, and we have measured isolation of more than 50~dB.  The 650~nm light is shuttered using a single or double passed AOM depending on the needs of the experiment being performed.

	\label{fig:ionizedba}
\end{figure}

These lasers are already sufficiently stable on short time scales to perform Doppler cooling, but they both exhibit slow frequency drifts on the order of 1~MHz/min that makes it difficult to perform long experiments without stabilization.  For this reason both lasers are stabilized to optical cavities.  The light sent to the optical cavities is offset by an adjustable frequency offset using a DPAOM.  The frequency detuning of the DPAOM is modulated at 20~kHz to modulate the cavity signal.  A phase shifter, frequency mixer, and low pass filter are used to demodulate the cavity signal with the reference 20~kHz modulation signal.  The result is an error signal that crosses zero at the top of the cavity signal.  The error signal is sent through a PID controller and then to a piezoelectric element controlling the feedback frequency inside the ECDL.  As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:optics}, the light being sent to the optical cavity comes from the 0$^{th}$ order of an AOM used for shuttering the light going to the vacuum chamber.  For this reason, the optical power sent to the cavities can vary by a factor or 5 to 10.  The circuit described here is insensitive to this change in power because it stabilizes the laser to the top of the fringe, whereas the side-of-the-fringe circuit described earlier would cause large frequency shifts whenever the shuttering AOM was switched.

A 650~nm ECDL and a 986~nm ECDL are both used with the 986~nm laser being doubled to 493~nm light using a PPLN crystal.  Both lasers are divided into two separate paths to cool ions in separate vacuum chambers with the amount of power in each beam controllable by a HWP.  The lasers for each trap are then combined using a dichroic mirror and sent to the traps via single mode fiber (not shown).}
	\label{fig:optics}
\end{figure}

Cooling Ytterbium also involves a repump laser.  The cooling transition is at 369~nm and can be reached using a direct diode cooled to a few degrees celsius.  The excited state that is reached via this transition can also decay to a long-lived 6D$_{3/2}$ state.  Unlike in barium, it is most convenient to depopulate this state using a transition to a different excited state formed by exciting an electron from the f shell.  This transition at 935~nm does not introduce any other long-lived possible decay states and the cooling cycle is closed.  There is one other complication in working with ytterbium though.  The ion can be collisionally excited to the 5F$_{7/2}$ state, which has a lifetime of 7~years.  We currently do not have any way to repump from this state, which will limit the useful lifetimes of the ytterbium we trap.

The Ytterbium lasers are not currently shuttered in any way, although that will be necessary to perform quantum operations on ytterbium ions eventually.  They are again stabilized to optical cavities using a side of the fringe locking circuit similar to the one used with the 791~nm laser.

\section{Initialization and Readout}
\label{sec:initread}

Now we have successfully ionized, trapped, and cooled both Barium and Ytterbium ions.  In order to begin performing quantum information operations on this system, we need to find qubits in both that will satisfy the DiVincezo critera from Subsection~\ref{sec:divincenzo}.  In particular we need to choose two energy states that can be initialized to some simple state representing $\ket{0}$, stay coherent for long enough for our computation to take place, and then be measured.

Ytterbium-171 has some very desirable properties for implementing these criteria. It has nuclear spin $\frac{1}{2}$, which means that its ground state is split into two hyperfine levels with $F = 0$ and $F = 1$.  The $F = 0$ hyperfine level has only one possible m quantum number $m_F = 0$, which is obviously not magnetically sensitive.  The hyperfine splitting between the two $F$ levels is 12.6 ... GHZ \cite{}, and therefore laser line widths are small enough to frequency select which level to address.  The $F = 1$ hyperfine manifold has three possible magnetic moment alignments $m_F = -1, 0, 1$, and again there is a magnetically insensitive energy level available.  These two magnetically insensitive energy levels make excellent qubit levels.  Coherence times of greater than a second have been measured without any kind of magnetic shielding \cite{}.  

Initialization and readout of these energy levels is also very easy.  In order to address both levels, a 1~MHz linewidth laser can be tuned to the energy difference between the $F = 1$ manifold in the S$_\frac{1}{2}$ ground state and the $F = 0$ manifold in the P$_\frac{1}{2}$ excited state.  Due to angular momentum conservation the decay to the $F = 0$ manifold of the ground state is forbidden.  The ion will therefore continuously absorb and emit light on this transition until it off-resonantly scatters to the $F = 1$ manifold in the excited state.

Ytterbium-174 has none of these beneficial properties, but it is more naturally abundant and easier to cool because there are no additional hyperfine levels that need to be addressed to close the cooling cycle.  For this reason, and other experimental limitations we are currently working with Yb-174 instead, but actual quantum computation experiments will use Yb-171 in the future.

Choosing a qubit for operations in barium is somewhat more complicated.  There are three possible isotopes that might be considered for use in quantum computation. Barium-138 is most naturally abundant isotope and it has nuclear spin 0, and therefore there is no hyperfine structure to complicate its energy diagram.  Barium-137 has hyperfine structure because of its nuclear spin with I=$\frac{3}{2}$, however this does not give rise to the same nice properties as with I=$\frac{1}{2}$.  There are many more long lived states that have to be repumped and no simple selection rules allowing for easy detection.  There is an isotope of barium, Barium-133, with nuclear spin I=$i\frac{1}{2}$, but it undergoes radioactive decay with a half-life of 10.51(5)~yrs \cite{}.  Therefore an enriched sample must be used in order to work with this isotope.

Instead we have been working with the most abundant natural isotope, Barium-138. \ba has no nuclear spin and therefore no hyperfine structure.  Its ground states is a 6S$_{\frac{1}{2}}$ level with two Zeeman sublevels $m_J = \pm \frac{1}{2}$.  These levels are very sensitive to magnetic field and maintaining coherence beyond a significant fraction of the ac wall period would be difficult.  Fortunately, following the description of our architecture given earlier we don't need to store quantum information in both species for long periods of time.  Barium ions can be used to cool the ytterbium ions and to generate remote ion entanglement events.  The remote entanglement generate between barium ions can easily be transferred to ytterbium ions using a gate sequence of a few hundred microseconds. Since we can work around these problems and the ground state Zeeman levels are otherwise relatively easy to work with, we have chosen them to be the qubit levels in our current architecture.

Initialization of these levels is again fairly straightforward.  Circularly polarized light can be utilized in a technique called optical pumping to initialze the ion into either Zeeman state.  Again because of conservation of angular momentum the two circular polarization of light along the ions quantization axis $\sigma\pm$ must correspond to transitions with $\Delta m_J = \pm 1$.  Since the 493~nm transition in ionized barium transfers population between two states with angular momentum $J=\frac{1}{2}$, $\sigma^+$ 493~nm light cannot drive a transition from 6S$_\frac{1}{2} m_J = +\frac{1}{2}$ to any other state.  However, this light can drive transitions between the $m_J = -\frac{1}{2}$ level and the 6P$_\frac{1}{2}$ state. Once the transition is driven, the polarization of the emitted light and therefore the resulting ground state Zeeman level is random.  However, after the $\sigma^+$ polarized 493~nm light has been applied for a long period of time population will accumulate in the $m_J=+\frac{1}{2}$ level because no lasers are addressing this level.

In other trapping systems we have implemented this procedure using two separate 493~nm beams.  One beam is focused onto the ion with linear polarization with respect to the ions quantization axis and therefore can drive either transition and will Doppler cool the ion.  The other beam is sent in with a circular polarization, which will initialize the ions state to the dark ground state level but not cool effectively.  By shuttering the linearly polarized beam, the ion can be optically pumped to the state the circularly polarized beam does not address.

Since our setup switches the 986~nm beam before it is frequency doubled the optical pumping procedure can not be implemented in the same way because we cannot independently shutter two 493~nm beams well.  Instead a single 493~nm beam is sent to the trap.  The beam passes through a quater wave plate which initializes it to a circular polarization and then through a Pockels cell.  The Pockel's cell is oriented so that when charged to 1.1~kV the 493~nm beam can be rotated back towards linear polarization.  Therefore the 493~nm beam can be switched from performing Doppler cooling to performing optical pumping as quickly as the voltage can be switched in the Pockels cell.  We use a modified piezeoelectric actuator driver circuit to implement this switching in 2~ms or less based on a TTL signal.

In the final quantum computing device there will be no need to read out the state of the barium ions, and the short coherence time of the Zeeman sublevels will not present a significant challenge.  However, at the moment we have not completed setting up the infrastructure to allow us to transfer quantum entanglement to the ytterbium ion or the equipment to readout the state of the ytterbium ions.  Instead we are currently performing experiments with only the capability to control and measure the quantum state of the barium ions.

In order to readout the Zeeman levels of the barium ions we cannot play a simple trick as in ytterbium.  Unfortunately there are no selection rules to protect decays from the excited state to either of our qubit states.  Instead we have to transfer the population from one of the qubit states to a long-lived state outside of the cooling cycle.  In Figure~\ref{fig:ionizedba}, we can see that there is such a state, the 5D$_\frac{5}{2}$ state.  The 5D$_\frac{5}{2}$ state has a lifetime of 30~s \cite{}, which is more than sufficient since we can determine whether the ion is in the cooling cycle by monitoring its flourescence for 20~ms or less.

Population can be transferred to the \ba 5D$_\frac{5}{2}$ using a narrow, 1762~nm fiber laser.  This laser produces $\approx 10~mW$ of optical power with a linewidth of $\approx 100~Hz$ \cite{}.  It is locked to a temperature and pressure stabilized, Zeroder optical cavity with a linewidth of 500~kHz \cite{}.  With the power left after frequency stabilization, coherent pi-pulses from the 6S$_\frac{1}{2}$ ground state to the 5D$_\frac{5}{2}$ excited state can be achieved in 10~us.  Since the natural linewidth of the transition and the Rabi frequency with which we drive it are both much smaller than the separation between the two Zeeman levels we can frequency select which Zeeman level we are addressing.

Using this laser readout of the Zeeman state of the \ba ion is achieved by transferring of ``shelving'' one of the Zeeman states to the 5D$_\frac{5}{2}$ level.  The cooling lasers are then applied for 20~ms and a simple threshold is again used to separate background PMT count from the counts of a flourescing ion.  The ion will only be flourescing if the valence electron was initially in the unshelved Zeeman state.  Once this determination has been made, if the electron was successfully shelved it can be brought back into the cooling cycle without having to wait for the $\approx 30~s$ coherence time by applying light at 614~nm (see Figure~\ref{fig:ionizedba}).
