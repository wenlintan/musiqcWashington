The motional states of trapped ions are shared between all ions in the trap and provide a mechanism for transferring information between these ions.  By performing sequences of pulses exciting modes shared by two ions entangling gates can be implemented.

\section{Single Ion Normal Modes}
\label{sec:single-modes}

In the case of a single ion occupying a trapping region there are only three normal modes corresponding to the trap strength in each direction.  At the bottom of the trap the trapping potentials are harmonic and the motional states of the ion are well described by simple quantum harmonic oscillator states.  That is to say that we can label the motional states by $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$, etc. with energy $E_n = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2})$.  After normal Doppler cooling the ion occupies is in a thermal mixed state of these motional levels.  The state of the ion is therefore described by a parameter $\bar{n}$, the average motional occupation number and can be described by the density matrix 
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\bar{n}+1} \left( \frac{\bar{n}}{\bar{n} + 1} \right) ^ n \ket{n} \bra{n} \mathrm{.}
\end{equation}

In order to analyze how entangling gates can use these levels we will first make some simple measurements using them with a single ion.  In particular, measurements of $\bar{n}$ and its time derivative $\dot{\bar{n}}$ provide information that is likely to scale to larger numbers of ions in the same trap.  The average motional occupation number $\bar{n}$ provides information on how effective Doppler cooling is, and can be indicative of problems with this procedure.  The parameters $\dot{\bar{n}}$ is often called the heating rate, and is likely to be roughly constant per ion as more ions are added.

Motional heating in ion traps is a complicated phenomenon and is only recently beginning to be investigated systematically.  There are a number of phenomena known to cause some heating including electric field noise at the secular frequencies and parametric heating induced by the trapping rf \cite{}.  Heating rates seem to strongly increase as ions are brought closer to surfaces in ion traps, which has made the problem increasingly problematic as the community moves towards using surface traps where ions are located 40~um to 100~um from the surface of the trap.  Recent investigations have shown that this surface heating is probably due to electric field noise in contaminants deposited on the surface during the UHV bakeout \cite{}.  These contaminants can be removed by argon ion bombardment after bakeout, which significantly lowers the heating rate in the trap.

In order to analyze the normal modes of the ion trap, we have to understand the way electric fields can interact with them.  In particular, we will be driving sideband transitions using lasers addressing narrow transitions.  In order to gain some understanding of these processes, we will consider a two level atomic system consisting of $\ket{\downarrow}$ and $\ket{\uparrow}$.  In addition to these internal energy levels, we will consider motional energy levels in one dimension described by simple harmonic energy levels with energy spacing $\omega_z$.  Our base Hamiltonian is therefore 
\begin{equation}
H = \hbar \omega_\downarrow \ket{\downarrow} + \hbar \omega_\uparrow \ket{\uparrow} + \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \hbar \omega_z \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \ket{n}
\end{equation}
We will consider the interaction of this Hamiltonian with monochromatic radiation with the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H_I(t) = \hbar \Omega \left( \ket{\uparrow}\bra{\downarrow} + \ket{\downarrow} \bra{\uparrow} \right) \left( e^{i k_z x(t) + i \omega t + i \phi} + h.c. \right)
\end{equation}

...

Therefore, we can see that we can drive transitions between motional states of the ion.  In order to observe these sideband transitions in trapped barium ions we will use the technologies discussed in Section~\ref{sec:initread}.  We will trap and Doppler cool a single \ba ion, and then initialize its state to the $m_J$ = -1/2 level of its 6S$_{1/2}$ ground state by switching our cooling laser to have circular polarization.  We will then shutter the cooling lasers and apply a fixed duration pulse of 1762~nm light that is near the transition from the ground state to the $m_J$ = -1/2 level of the 5D$_{5/2}$ state.  Upon reactivating the cooling lasers we will see flourescence from the ion only if we were unsuccessful in driving a transition with 1762~nm laser.  This procedure is repeated multiple times to build statistics and then repeated at multiple frequencies to explore the frequency dependence of the transition. 

Figure~\ref{fig:freqscan} shows the result of this procedure.  The large center peak is the direct resonance that does not include any change in motional state.  There are both red and blue sidebands of this transition visible.  The strength of the sidebands is related to the carrier transition by $\sqrt{\eta} \bar{n}$ and therefore depends on the photon momentum, the motional secular frequency, and the occupation number.  The two sidebands that are shown are the radial sidebands with secular frequencies of 1.31~MHz and 1.21~MHz.  The 1762~nm laser is oriented perpendicular to the axial trap axis and therefore the photon momentum in that direction is zero and no sideband transition can be seen.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{FullScan}
	\caption{Shelving probability as a function of 1762~nm laser detuning.  A strong carrier transition is present at offset 85.6~MHz, while symmetric sidebands can be seen at 84.3~MHz, 84.4~MHz, 86.75~MHz, and 86.85~MHz.}
	\label{fig:freqscan}
\end{figure}

Using this technology we would then like to estimate the initial temperature and heating rate of our ions.  There are two possible methods for performing this procedure.  We could compare the strength of the sidebands to the strength of the carrier and use the weak excitation limit to extract $\sqrt{\eta} \bar{n}$ for each peak.  The difficulty with this strategy is that the radial modes must be weakly excited in order to extract this information, and errors on fitting the heights of the peaks are often large.  Instead for single ions it is easier to measure the decay of Rabi oscillations.

Since our 1762~nm source has a linewidth $\le$ 1~kHz we should be able to apply pulses of hundreds of microseconds of duration without seeing any noticable decoherence of Rabi oscillations.  Instead these oscillations tends to decay in 100~us to 200~us because of the finite temperature of our ions.  The source of this decoherence is driving carrier (not sideband) transitions that start in different motional hamronic oscillator states.  The sideband transitions are far enough away in frequency that they are not relevant, but these carrier transitions at different motional energies are slightly shifted in frequency with respect to one another.  Since the ion is in a thermal state, all of these transitions of slightly different frequency are driven and their interference appears as the decoherence of the oscillations.

The Rabi frequency for these excited motional level carrier transitions follows from the above discussion of sideband transitions and is
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{n,n} = \Omega e^{-\eta^2/2} L_n^0 ( \eta^2 )
\end{equation}
which can be simplified for small $\eta^2$ to $\Omega ( 1 - \eta^2 n )$.  In order to understand the effect of temperature we can write the probability of shelving as a sum over a thermal distribution of motional states. The shelving probability becomes
\begin{equation}
P_\mathrm{shelve} (t) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\bar{n} + 1} * \left( \frac{\bar{n}}{\bar{n} + 1} \right) ^n \cos \left( 2 * \Omega_{n,n} * t \right) 
\end{equation}
This analysis has all been performed assuming there is only one motional degree of freedom.  If the ion has multiple modes of motion there is a corresponding Lamb-Dicke parameter, $\eta$ and thermal average occupation number, $\bar{n}$, for each mode.  In order to generate the shelving probability we would have to sum over all possible combinations of occupation number weighted by their thermal probability for each mode.  For even a few modes this calculation becomes very time consuming, and it is not possible to easily fit data to the free parameters.  Fitting could be done by Monte Carlo sampling from the distribution of occupation numbers, but the fitting time is still large to achieve reasonable accuracy.

Instead we have chosen to only address the radial modes of motion which are separated in frequency by $\le$ 10\%.  It is therefore resonable to approximate their occupation numbers and Lamb-Dicke parameters as equal.  Since the axial secular frequency is much lower this procedure would not be possible if the 1762~nm laser also addressed this state, but that is not the case.  Making this approximation we can extract a parameter $\sum_i \bar{n}_i$, where the sum extends over the average thermal occupation numbers of the radial modes, from an experimental Rabi flop curve.

Using this procedure, we would like to find the final temperature we achieve with Doppler cooling, as well as the rate at which the ion heats while Doppler cooling is diabled.  In order to find this heating rate of the ion, we can allow it to sit uncooled for a period of time before applying 1762~nm pulses to it.  In Figure~\ref{fig:rabi-heating} we can see that as we wait longer the ion increases in temperature and the Rabi oscillation decay more rapidly as expected.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{HeatingRateT0Orange}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{HeatingRateT50000Orange}
	\caption{Rabi oscillations with different delays between the end of Doppler cooling and the beginning of 1762~nm laser exposure.  The Rabi oscillations decay much quicker after a delay of 50~ms (right) than with no delay (left).}
	\label{fig:rabi-heating}
\end{figure}

Although heating in ion traps is complicated and several heating mechanisms are certainly nonlinear, it is common to approximate it as linear.  This approximation holds well at least for small temperatures.  As the ion increases in temperature and experiences more of the trap anharmonicity and rf-induced micromotion heating rates tend to increase.  The total radial quanta of our single trapped barium ion is fit to 122~quanta, with a heating rate of 2.43~quanta/ms (see Figure~\ref{fig:heating-nonoise}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{HeatingRate}
	\caption{Total ion radial quanta is plotted as a function of delay time before the experimental sequence begins during which the ion is not cooled.  A linear fit is shown with initial radial average thermal occupation number 122~quanta and a 2.43~quanta/ms heating rate.}
	\label{fig:heating-nonoise}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, the initial temperature of the ion was significantly hotter than would be expected.  Doppler cooling barium ions with 493~nm light should result in ion temperatures of . Instead we see Doppler temperature approximately an order of magnitude higher at $\approx$ 50 quanta per radial mode of motion.  By modeling the strength of the sidebands we can drive as described above we can tell that our Doppler temperature is not actually this high.  Instead, this effect is being caused by frequency variations in our 1762~nm laser.

This laser is locked to a 500~kHz linewidth cavity by a locking circuit that stabilizes it to within a few percent of the maximum cavity signal.  This small oscillation still corresponds to a frequency modulation of the laser with a modulation depth of 10~kHz to 20~kHz.  This oscillation is very slow compared to timescale of the pulses we apply to the ion.  The result is that every run of our Rabi flop experiment sees an approximately constant frequency drawn from this 20~kHz wide distribution of frequencies.  The result of this procedure is easily simulated by performing this sampling in software.  The shelving probability, $P_{\mathrm{shelved}}$, is given by
\begin{equation}
	P_{\mathrm{shelved}}(t) = \int_f \frac{1}{\sigma_f \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(f - \mu_f)^2 }{2 \sigma_f^2}} \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm{rabi}}^2}{\Omega_{\mathrm{rabi}}^2 + (f - f_\mathrm{transition})^2} * \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm{rabi}}^2}{\Omega_{\mathrm{rabi}}^2 + (f - f_\mathrm{transition})^2} * t / 2 \right)
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_f$ is the width of the approximately gaussian spread of frequencies ($\approx$ 20~kHz), $\mu_f$ is the center of this distribution which is approximately equal to $f_\mathrm{transition}$ which is the center of the 1762~nm transition, $\Omega_\mathrm{rabi}$ is the rabi frequency ($\approx$ 50~kHz with our achievable laser power).  The resulting curve also exhibits a loss of contrast on the 100~us time scale.

Given the approximate width of this noise we can combine the two preceding equations and fit our Rabi flops to this curve.  The fit parameters are the Rabi frequency $\Omega$, the optical pumping efficiency $s$, and the sum of the radial average thermal occupation numbers $\sum_i \bar{n}_i$.  In Figure~\ref{fig:heating}, the heating rate of the radial modes is again approximately linear, with an initial temperature that is reasonable for a Doppler cooled barium ion.  The linear fit shown corresponds to an initial $\sum_i \bar{n}_i$ = 17~quanta, with a heating rate of 2.84~quanta/ms.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{HeatingRateNoise}
	\caption{Measured radial motional average occupation numbers as a function of the period of time the ion was allowed to heat before the 1762~nm pulse began.}
	\label{fig:heating}
\end{figure}

The heating rate after the correction for the 1762~nm laser noise is similar to the uncorrected heating rate, and it seems that the two losses of contrast have approximately the same effect.  There does not seem to be any new behaviour when the two sources act together.  We will use this measure of our single ion heating rate to consider our results with ion chains in the next section.  We expect that the heating rate per ion should be approximately constant for small numbers of ions because their trapping environment is very similar.

\section{Mixed Species Ion Chains}
\label{sec:mixed-modes}

In order to analyze transferring quantum information between ions we first need to understand the normal mode structure of a chain of ions.  Since we are working with multiple ion species we will also consider the case that the mass of each ion may be different.  The normal modes for any given number of each species of ion and any ordering of those species can easily be calculated through normal classical mechanical techniques.  When the dynamics are much slower than the rf period the Mathieu equation can be ignored and the trapping potential can be written as a simple harmonic oscillator.  The base trapping potential is then
\begin{equation}
	V_\mathrm{trap} = \omega_x x^2 + \omega_y y^2 + \omega_z z^2 \mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_z$ is the axial confinement generated by the dc electrodes that is necessarily weaker than $\omega_x$ and $\omega_y$.  The radial secular frequencies are a function of the ion mass and therefore are different for the different ion species.  This interaction is modified by the Coulomb interaction between the ions
\begin{equation}
	V_\mathrm{coulomb} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^N \sum\limits_{j \ne i} \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{ \left| \vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j \right| } \mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of ions in the trap and $e$ is the proton charge (we have assumed the ions are singly ionized).

Near the bottom of the potential well, the linear terms are zero and the potential can be approximated by
\begin{equation}
	V_{ij} = \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_i } \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } ( V_\mathrm{trap} + V_\mathrm{coulomb} ) 
\end{equation}
neglecting the constant potential.  The equations of motion are then given by
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{x_i} + V_{ij} x_j = 0 \mathrm{.}
\end{equation}
There are 3N solutions which take the form of independent harmonic oscillators.  Each harmonic oscillator corresponds to motion along one of the eigenvectors of the matrix $V_{ij}$ with an angular frequency $w$ equal to the square root of the corresponding eigenvalue.

The analysis of sideband transitions still carries through with small modifications.  Our $x(t)$ operator is now written as $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3N} $.

Scanning these radial modes can follow almost the exact procedure described for scanning over the radial modes with a single barium ion.  One difference is that state detection must be done with our EMCCD camera instead of with the PMT.  The PMT has no spatial sensitivity and cannot distinguish which ions in the chain are shelved.  I have developed software that integrates our experiment with the EMCCD camera and automatically detects shelving events for all ions in a chain.

One additional difference is that data can only be collected when the ions are ordered in one particular configuration.  Performing experiments involving these mixed species chains is complicated by the fact that the normal mode structure changes depending on the ordering of the ion species in addition to the numbers of each ion.  In the future, this work can be done in microfabricated traps where dc control voltages can be used to separate, reorder, and merge ions.  At the moment the ions are randomly reordered by shuttering the Doppler cooling beams and allowing the ions to heat for a period of time.  When the ions recrystallize their order may have randomly changed to the correct order.  Since this procedure is entirely random it becomes more unlikely to reach the correct configuration as the number of possible configurations increases.

We have performed initial characterizations of chains of two barium and two ytterbium ions.  This chain length is short enough that we can achieve the correct ion ordering enough of the time to take reasonable amounts of data.  It is long enough to allow us to investigate the effects of clustering or distributing the barium ions throughout the chain.  We are most interested in how effectively the ytterbium ions can be kept cooled by Doppler cooling the barium ions.

	\caption{Shelving probability as a function of frequency detuning of the 1762~nm source.  Multiple radial sideband transitions can be seen and their strengths are fit to average thermal occupation numbers.}
	\label{fig:radial-byby}
\end{figure}

First we will consider the case where the barium ions are maximally dispersed in the ion chain.  In order the chain is composed of barium, ytterbium, barium, and ytterbium.  In Figure~\ref{fig:radial-byby}, a sample radial mode scan in shown.  The two data curves are the probability of shelving the barium ion in that position as a function of the 1762~nm laser detuning.  The second curve is offset from the first to be more easily visible.  In both cases the shelving percentage does not exceed 35\% and has been kept deliberately low to allow us to fit each peak to the weak excitation limit.   In this limit, the shelving probability is given by
\begin{equation}
	P_\mathrm{shelve}(\omega) = \frac{1}{4} e_i^2 \eta**2 \bar{n} \Omega^2 t^2 \sin^2( (\omega - \omega_0)/ \omega_\mathrm{width} ) \mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency, $\omega_0$ is the center frequency of the transition, $\omega_\mathrm{width}$ is an artifical broadening term that absorbs the natural width as well as the frequency noise of the 1762~nm laser.  In order to fit to this equation we need to know the Rabi frequency of the 1762~nm laser for each ion.  We find this by also performing a Rabi experiment with the same system.

The radial mode frequencies  and eigenvectors are found by the numerical procedure above, but the measured radial mode frequencies display small 10~kHz to 20~kHz shifts from these frequencies.  We believe these shifts are due to small offsets in the error signal of the 1762~nm laser.  The ZeroDer cavity that it is locked to also displays mechanical relaxation at a rate of 10~kHz/day, which explains some of the shifts because of the 6 hour experimental run time.


Figure~\ref{fig:radial-byby} shows the predicted radial modes given our independently measured trap secular frequncies as black vertical lines.  The positions of the modes after the small frequency shifts are fit to them are indicated by the positions pointed to by the arrows, which label the fit $\bar{n}$ to each peak.  The four lowest frequency modes have large eigenvector motional components in ytterbium ions, but very small motional components for both barium ions.  It is clear that these modes are not being well cooled by the barium ions.  The mode frequencies, barium eigenvector components, and $\bar{n}$ for this configuration are given below.

\begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth}{ |>{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X|>{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X@{} >{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X|>{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X| }

It is clear that there is a very large difference in the amount of motion that the last four modes have in barium ions than the first four.  We can also observe that having both eigenvector components be of the same magntiude does not decrease the number of quanta in the mode signifcantly, but even slightly increasing the maximum eigenvector component can have large effect.  Additionally, the participation of the barium ions is increased when the base secular frequency for that direction is smaller.  When we move all of the barium ions to one side of the chain such that the order is barium, barium, ytterbium, then ytterbium we measure the following.

\begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth}{ |>{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X|>{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X@{} >{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X|>{\setlength\hsize{1\hsize}\centering}X| }

The last case we have considered is where the barium ions are on either end of the chain such that the ions are ordered barium, ytterbium, ytterbium, and then barium.

The last data point in this set seems to be an outlier in the further analysis.  There is some possibilty that since this is the lowest frequency point the 1762~nm laser stabilization system malfunctioned and the error was not noticed at the time.  Repeating the data collection with all of the identical parameters is probably not possible at this point in time, so instead, for the subsequent analysis, this data point will be ignored as an outlier.

In order to gain a simplifed understanding of what this data tells us about the temperature of ions in mixed species ion chains, we tried comparing the $\bar{n}$ for each radial mode that is not cooled well by barium to its eigenvector components for barium ions.  The correlation between these variable seems to be strongest when we compare the $\bar{n}$ to $max \left| e_\alpha \right|^2$.  Plotting these against each other shows a strong correlation, with reasonable thermal occupation numbers only being reached when the eigenvector component $e_\alpha \approx$ 0.04.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{RadialNBarEigenvectors}
	\caption{Radial $\bar{n}$ as a function of the maximum eigenvector component with a barium ion squared.  The linear trend is given as a guide to the eye.}
	\label{radial-nbars}
\end{figure}

Obviously cooling ytterbium ions using only barium cooling lasers is not going to be as efficient as we would hope.  It seems that that our Doppler cooling is still near optimal for barium ions, so it is unlikely that Doppler cooling alone will be able to perform any better than this.  There are still a few options for making progress however.  For the weaker of the two trap axes, we can see that the ytterbium modes are reasonably cold for chain configurations that are well mixed.  Only a few modes of the trap will need to be kept cold to perform entangling gates in ytterbium, and its possible the trap strengths and ion configuration can be arranged to make this possible.  Doing so will likely require the barium to be well distributed thoughout the chain.

Investigating these problems for increasing numbers of ions should prove very itneresting.  If the trends established above continue to hold it may still be possible to keep a few modes cold enough to be in the Lamb-Dicke regime and perform entangling operations in ytterbium.  Working with more ions will most likely involve moving this experiment to a surface electrode trap where the ordering of the ions can be easily controlled.  Scaling this experiment further in its current trap would be very difficult.

\section{Ion Species Reordering}
\label{sec:reordering}

Working with mixed ion species chains gives an experimenter the ability to determine when chains reorder.  Obviously when working with only a single ion species, the ions are indistinguishable and it is impossible to tell whether its order is the same as previously at any point in time.  We hypothesized that the reordering of ions would happen at a relatively constant temperature and therefore could provide a simple temperature or heating rate measurement.  To investigate this hypothesis we performed simulations of the motion of mixed ion species chains.

Heating in ion chains is difficult to model and therefore we chose to not attempte to simulate it.  Instead the ions are initialized at the beginning of the simulation to a given temperature.  Depending on this initial temperature, we track the probability for them to reorder before they are cooled to somewhere near their ground state.  The initial temperature is modeled by initializing the ions velocity to the corresponding energy with a random direction.  The ions motion is then modeled subject to the differential equation
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\vec{x}_i} = -\vec{\omega}^2 \vec{x} + \hbar \vec{k} \frac{\Gamma}{2} \frac{s}{1 + s + 4 \left( \frac{\delta + \vec{k} \cdot \vec{v}}{\Gamma} \right)^2}	+ \sum\limits_{i \ne j} \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{ \left| \vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j \right| ^3 } \left( \vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j \right) \mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{x}_i$ is the position of the ion that begain in position $i$, $\vec{\omega}$ is the three harmoic trap frequencies, $\vec{k}$ ... .  At the end of this procedure, it is determined whether the ion species have reordered in a way that is experimentally detectable.  Figure~\ref{fig:reorderingpos} shows a subset of the axial positions of a chain of ions from a single run of the simulation where the ions reorder.  Repeating this process several thousand times for several temperatures shows us that the probability to reorder changes relatively sharply with temperature.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ReorderingPositions}
	\caption{Simulated axial positions of ions as function of time.  The ions begin with a large randomly directed velocity and are slowly cooled by simulated Doppler cooling.}
	\label{fig:reorderingpos}
\end{figure}

Experimentally, this phenomenon is very easy to observe.  Once again heating can be caused by allowing the ion to spend several milliseconds uncooled in the trap.  Using our EMCCD camera we image the ions before and after a given time period of uncooled time.  The reordering probability is then extracted from a series of many such experiments.  In order to fit the collected data to the theory curve generated before need to fit the initial temperature and heating rate of the ion chain.  

In Figure~\ref{fig:reordering}, the resulting curves for an ion chain of 7 barium and one ytterbium ion are shown fit to one another.  The initial temperature is ...

The advantage of this technique is that a single, fast measurement can quickly characterize the temperature properties of the trap.  With the methods described earlier in this chapter several dozen data points each comprised of several hundred experimental runs must be performed to fit a function and determine the ions' temperature or heating rate.  With this method, collecting one or two data points near the maximum slope of the reordering probability can generate a quick measurement of the same quantity.  The reordering measurement also does not require any narrow transitions to be addressed, so traps can quickly be characterized even before these additional lasers are aligned to them.

Since these measurements are so quick to carry out, it is also convenient to look at how our Doppler temperature varies with our 493~nm laser frequency using this technique.  Figure~\ref{fig:reordering-cooling} plots the reordering probability as a function of the detuning of this main barium cooling laser with the uncooled time in the experiment set to the maximal reordering slope.  Collecting this data using this method took only a few minutes as compared to an hour or more to measure several curves with the other methods described.  For this reason, reordering measurements also serve as a good, fast indicator of cooling efficacy.
