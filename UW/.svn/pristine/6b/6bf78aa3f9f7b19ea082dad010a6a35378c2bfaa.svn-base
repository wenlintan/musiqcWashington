Hopefully, I have convinced you by now that trapped ions offer the potential to easily realize the building blocks of a quantum computer.  The difficulty in performing useful quantum computing tasks with them is then relatively easily reduced to the problem of having a sufficient number of communicating qubits available.  A single ion trap can easily confine ten ions, but as more ions are loaded into the trap difficulties begin to arise.  It becomes increasingly difficult to stably trap large chains, and once trapped it is more difficult to spatially address individual ions with lasers and to address individual entangling transitions between ions in frequency.  The motional amplitude per ion in each mode is reduced and the additional motional modes of the trap contribute to decoherence through off-resonant processes.

\section{MUSIQC Architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

To address these issues a collaboration of ion trappers proposed a new ion trapping architecture that works towards scalability in three ways. The architecture is known as the Modular Universal Scalable Ion-Trap Quantum Computer (MUSIQC).  The first increase in scalability is to implement additional voltage degrees of freedom to improve our control of dc electric fields in ion traps.   This technology will enable us to trap additional ions in a single trapping region and to form additional trapping regions in each vacuum chamber.  In order to easily address and image ions from outside of the vacuum chamber, it is far preferrable to crystallize them in a linear chain.  Therefore, their axial confining strength must be kept weaker than their radial confining strength.  The difficulty arises that, as more ions are loaded into the same trap, the ions at the outer ends of the chain provide additional axial confinement to the center ions.  The result of which is that trapping increasing numbers of ions in a linear chain requires increasing amounts of radial strength.  Especially for heavier ions species, increasing radial strength can become difficult quickly.

In order to correct for this effect it is desirable to lower the axial confinement that the center ions experience without compromising the confinement of the entire chain.  Since ions are very sensitive to electric fields, it is easy to add additional controls to their confinement just by adding more dc control electrodes.  In order to have many small control electrodes, ion traps that are made using standard micromanufacturing techniques have been developed.  These techniques have been used in the condensed matter community for decades and transfer very well to the manufacture of small ion traps.  Using these additional trap degree of freedom we expect to be able to trap $\approx$ 20 ions in a trapping region.

Using these additional dc voltage controls, it is also possible to generate and control multiple trapping regions inside the same vacuum chamber.  In fact, generating multiple trapping locations, and separating ions from and merging ions into these regions has already been demonstrated \cite{Moehring:11,Bowler:12}.  While entangling operations can only occur between ions in the same trapping region, ions carrying information can be shuttled between different regions without decoherence \cite{Bowler:12}.  The separation and merging operations using our current dc control systems takes several milliseconds, and the operation might be complicated depending on how many ions need to be reordered to transfer the desired information.

Using these techniques it is possible to store hundreds of ions inside a single vacuum chamber.  While this would be a very impressive technical demonstration, it would not be a modular system and additional scalability would be difficult.  Also, adding more trapping regions to each vacuum chamber increases the difficulty of shuttling ions between them.  All of the fields applied to the ions need to be carefully focused and directed to avoid interacting with the many other ions inside the $\approx$ 1~cm diameter micro-trap.  Applying rf and microwave control fields to single ions in such systems would be very difficult because of their wavelengths, which is unfortunate because many desirable qubit levels are separated by these frequencies.   While none of these difficulties are insurmountable, a separate, additional method of scaling our system will almost certainly prove useful.

The second way that we propose to work towards scalability is by transferring entanglement between separate vacuum chambers.  This brings us to another advantage of working with ions.  Given an appropriate choice of qubit, it is very easy to generate entanglement between ions and single photons.  The resulting state of the emitting ion can be encoded into the frequency and polarization of the emitted photon.  The problem of coupling quantum information in ions in multiple vacuum chambers is then reduced to the problem of coupling photons between the chambers.  

Coupling photons together is a problem that has already been almost entirely solved.  Optical fiber technology is available that will transfer photons from ions with reasonable loss rates.  Any necessary operations on the photons polarization or frequency can be accomplished using optical fiber tools.  The only remaining difficulty is interconnecting the fibers of any desired pair of ion traps.  This last task can be accomplished using a custom microelectromechanical system (MEMS) of mirrors to redirect light from an input array of fibers to any desired output fibers which has already been demonstrated \cite{Olkhovets:04}. 

For reasons discussed in the next section, this photonic information transfer will be significantly slower than the timescale of other operations in the trap.  Quantum gates between ions in the same trap can usually be performed at rates of $\approx$ 100~kHz to 1~MHz.  Shuttling ions containing information between separate trapping regions can be accomplished at a rate of $\approx$ 1~kHz - 10~kHz.  Transferring quantum information between remote ions in separate vacuum chambers currently takes $\approx$ 1~s to 10~s, but we believe that we can reduce this time to $\approx$ 10~ms.

Nevertheless, quantum algorithms will be possible using this architecture. Analysis has shown that the MUSIQC architecture compares favorably with other commonly suggested scalable quantum computer architectures \cite{Monroe:14}.  The slower remote entanglement step also does not preclude the implementation of quantum error correction.  Quantum error correction is a complicated scheme by which a single qubit value is encoded into multiple physical qubits so that simple errors in the quantum gates can be avoided.  It is expected to be difficult to perform large quantum algorithms without error correction because it is difficult to engineer quantum gates with high enough fidelity that large computations do not often fail.

The third technique we have been developing is the use of multiple ion species in the same trapping region.  This idea developed out of necessity from the difficulty in cooling ions and performing quantum operations with the same ion species.

\section{Remote Entanglement}
\label{sec:remote}

The proposed MUSIQC architecture involves multiple separate vacuum chambers with lasers for cooling and quantum operations.  Each vacuum chamber features a few locations that are optically coupled to a single mode optical fiber.  Light from different ions can then be brought to a MEMS-based mirror switching system, which can combine light from different fibers reliably and repeatably.

The one complication to this scheme is the difficulty in collecting large fractions of the photons that an ion emits and focusing those photons onto other ions.  In order to generate entanglement it is necessary to be able to detect a single photon emitted by an ion.  A straightforward ion trap that was not designed with this feature in mind will usually collect and image approximately 2\% of the available ion flourescence.  As a result the probability of successfully managing to entangle two ions in distant traps in a single trial will be vanishingly small.  Attempting the entanglement and hoping that it worked is not a realistic possibility.  Fortunately, there is a protocol by which it can be determined whether the entanglement process was successful without performing a measurement that would destroy the entanglement.

Instead of attempting to directly couple photons carrying information from one ion onto another ion, we will separately collect such photons from both ions simultaneously.  For example, considering vacuum chambers $A$ and $B$, photon quantum states $\ket{H}$ and $\ket{V}$, and ion quantum states $\ket{\uparrow}$ and $\ket{\downarrow}$ we will generate the states
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{i=A,B} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{H}_{i}\ket{\uparrow}_{i} + \ket{V}_{i}\ket{\downarrow}_{i} \right)\mathrm{.}
\end{equation}
The photon states need to be some distinguishable photon states maximally entangled with the ion states.  Polarization states can be used easily or frequency states can be used if the frequency separation is larger than the linewidth of the transition.  We can then overlap the photon spatial modes on a 50-50 beamsplitter at some other location.  When single photon detectors placed at both output ports of the beamsplitter are simultaneously triggered that will correspond to measuring the photon state as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{H}_A\ket{V}_B + \ket{V}_A\ket{H}_B \right)$.  We can determine the resulting state of the ion by projecting that state onto this measurement.  The ions are left in the state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{\uparrow}_A \ket{\downarrow}_B + \ket{\downarrow}_A + \ket{\uparrow}_B \right)
\end{equation}
which is a maximally entangled state of the ion qubits.  This procedure is usually destructive of the ions initial state, but remotely entangled qubits can be prepared in advance and used a resource during the computation.

	\label{fig:remoteentangle}
\end{figure}

In any given attempt an entangled ion-photon pair can be generated with probability $P$ given by,
\begin{equation}
	P = P_\mathrm{exc} f  \eta \frac{\Omega}{4 \pi} f_\mathrm{gate} T
\end{equation}
where $P_\mathrm{exc}$ is the probabilty of driving the transition to the excited state ($\approx$ 0.2 in our current experimental setup), $f$ is the branching ratio back to the initial state if other decays are possible ($\approx$ 0.75), $\eta$ is the quantum efficiency of the single photon detector ($\approx$ 0.2), $\Omega$ is the solid angle for the collection optics ($\approx 0.02 * 4 \pi$), $f_\mathrm{gate}$ is the fraction of emitted photons in our detection window ($\approx$ 0.8), and $T$ accounts for other losses including transmission through all other optics ($\approx$ 0.3).  These factors limit us to generating an entangled pair only every 400~ms given our 17~kHz repetition rate\cite{Auchter:14}.  

Generating an entangled ion-ion pair requires the simultaneous generation of two ion-photon pairs which means that it only succeeds with probably proportional to $P^2$.  The photons must also be transmitted through a length of optical fiber, have their spatial modes overlapped, and be in a correct state to allow the heralded entanglement scheme to occur, but these factors are insignificant or unavoidable.  The largest achievable gains in our apparatus would be to $P_\mathrm{exc}$ which can easily be increased to unity, and $\Omega$ which can be increased by a factor of 5 to 10.  The MUSIQC collaborators are exploring a number of possible methods to improve $\Omega$ including in vacuum cavities \cite{Sterk:12} and diffractive optics \cite{Clark:14}.  Gang Shu and CK Chou have designed and built an ion trap inside of a parabolic mirror which can be used to collect $\ge 40\%$ of an ion's flourescence\cite{Shu:11}, and we are working to implement this experiment in that system.

Using currently available technology a remote ion-ion entanglement rate of $\approx$ 10~Hz to 100~Hz is feasible and we are working towards achieving that goal.

\section{Mixed Ion Species}
\label{sec:mixed}

Unfortunately, as the implementation of this scheme proceeded, field crosstalk was still a problematic issue.  The generation of remote entangled ion pairs still requires the application of resonant laser beams on strong transitions.  Even with ion separations of 10~microns, well focused lasers can still scatter hundreds of photons per second from neighboring ions.  Scattering any photon will completely destroy the quantum information that might have previously been held in the ion, and can quickly disrupt an entire calculation.  The determination was eventually made that we needed to take measures to avoid this problem.

The method chosen to minimize the field crosstalk issue was to use separate ion species for quantum computation and the remote entanglement generation.  This choice cements the idea of remote entangled pairs as a computational resource.  One ion species can be dedicated to generating many entangled pairs that can be transferred into the computation by quantum teleporting the entanglement onto the computational ion species.  Only the computational ion species will store quantum information for any significant period of time or perform any calculations with it.  Previous work towards a similar mixed ion species system has been done with small numbers of ions already \cite{Lin:13}.

Another advantage of adapting this scheme is that there are now many ions motionally coupled to the computational ions, but with well separated transition frequencies.  Laser cooling can be performed continuously on the remote entanglement species with a negligible chance of scattering a photon from the computational ions.  Since the two species are motionally coupled, it should be possible to keep the entire chain of ions cold without affecting ongoing quantum algorithms.  By using quantum gates that are insensitive to small motional occupation numbers and electromagnetically-induced-transparency cooling \cite{Lin:13, Roos:00} it may even be possible to avoid ever having to laser cool the computational ions.  This would allow quantum algorithms to continue running until qubit begins to decohere instead of being forced to stop by heating issues as is often the case.  The use of the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:qcomp} is also helpful here because of its resistance to decoherence even when performed at finite ion temperatures and during ion heating.

The added difficulty in only laser cooling one species is that different ion species obviously have different masses, which causes each normal mode of the chain to couple more strongly to one ion species than the other.  For large mass differences, this imbalance can make it impossible to cool one ion species using the other.  Each mode will have eigenvector components of order one with one ion species and all of its eigenvector components with the other ion species may be $\le$ 0.01 or even less.  The result is that even with large amounts of energy in this mode, the ion species being laser cooled may have very little motion.  

It is hoped that by choosing ion species with small mass differences and by exploring other degrees of freedom, this cooling scheme may be possible.  These other degrees of freedom include number and arrangement of the cooling ions and overall trap strengths and anharmonicities.  After going through our ion trapping, cooling, initialization, and readout procedures in more detail in Chapters~\ref{sec:trap} and \ref{sec:ioncool}, I will explore these ideas further.

The two ion species that will be used for the MUSIQC program are ytterbium and barium.  Ytterbium-171 has a pair of ground state levels with excellent insensitivty to magnetic fields.  These levels have very long coherence times and the state of the ion can be determined using a simple optical setup.  Barium has the advantage of having a strong transition at 493~nm, which is a long wavelength transition among ion species that can be laser cooled.  This wavelength is transmitted through fibers easier than more ultraviolet transitions which will improve the rate at which remote entangled pairs can be generated.  Further the two species are relatively close in mass, which should help to increase their motional coupling.
