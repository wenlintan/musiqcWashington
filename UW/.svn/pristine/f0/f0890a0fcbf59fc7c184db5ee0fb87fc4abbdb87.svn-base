As we make progress towards effectively cooling these ion chains we want to begin exploring how effective quantum operations can be engineered in ions in them.  We have begun performing single qubit quantum gates with barium ions in our system, and are preparing the necessary equipment to being characterizing entangling gates.  Although these single qubit rotations are simplistic we will soon be able to start using them to explore quantum coherence in this system.

\section{Zeeman Transitions}
\label{sec:zeeman}

The Zeeman qubit I have described in barium as well as the hyperfine qubit in ytterbium have large magnetic moments.  Coherent control of these qubits can be implemented using oscillating magnetic fields.  In our group we have some traps that have been designed to accomodate applying large magnetic fields to ions by placing good conductors along paths inside of the vacuum chamber near the ion.  Our quantum information vacuum chambers were not designed to incorporate this feature, and for the moment we are applying the fields from outside them.

We have demonstrated our ability to find and drive Zeeman transitions using an external field coil driven by a Stanford SRS-345 frequency source.  The field coil is composed of approximately 20 turns of copper wire and is located on our imaging viewport as close to the ion as possible.  The rf can be crudely coupled onto this coil by making a basic resonant circuit by adding capacitance to cancel the coil's inductance near the Zeeman transition frequency.

The experimental procedure to observe these transitions again begins by switching the cooling lasers to perform optical pumping and pumping the ion into one of the Zeeman states, which I will call $\ket{0}$.  The cooling lasers are then shuttered and we attempt to drive a Zeeman transition at our Zeeman transition frequency $\omega$ = 14.610~MHz.  After this attempt we apply a $\pi$-pulse of 1762~nm light the drive $\ket{0}$ to some Zeeman level in the 5D$_{5/2}$ state of barium with a probability of approximately 90\%.  Finally, we reactivate the cooling lasers and the ion flouresces if it has not been successfully shelved into the 5D$_{5/2}$ state.

For our initial characterization of this process, we have only been able to apply relatively small magnetic fields to the ion.  Figure~\ref{fig:zeeman-rabi} shows the shelving probabilty as a function of the exposure time of our rf source tuned to resonate with the Zeeman transition.  The beginning of a Rabi oscillation is clear, but then the frequency and amplitude of the transition begin to change.  These changes are due to the changing magnetic field in the trap because of the ac wall phase.  All of our magnetically sensitive experiments are triggered to begin on a maximum of the ac wall voltage, but since this experiment lasts for several milliseconds we begin to see the magnetic field shift.

The fidelity of this qubit operation is currently low, but it demonstrates that we have the infrastructure to support these kinds of operations.  The fidelity could be quickly improved by using amplifiers and resonators to apply a stronger magnetic field to the ion.  Increasing our magnetic field would allow us to minimize the size of the magnetic field drift.  Our maximum shelving probability could also be signifcantly improved by carefully improving our optical pumping efficiency and Doppler cooling efficiency.  In actual quantum information processing it will be more important to improve the fidelity of the qubit rotation operations because many of these operations must be performed before a single measurement in a quantum operation.  The accumulation of errors in qubit operations over the course of algorithms is going to be one of the next challenging problems to address in trapped ion quantum computing.

\section{Raman Transitions}
\label{sec:raman-trans}

The difficulty with performing qubit rotations using this direct technique is that the energy separation between ideal qubit levels can often be very small.  Therefore, near resonant radiation will have a long wavelength and be difficult to address onto single ions.  For example, the qubit we will address in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ has an energy splitting of approximatel 12~GHz, which corresponds to radiation with a wavelength of approximately 2.5~cm.  Typical ion separations in a single trapping region are 5~um to 10~um.  For performing quantum algorithms where we need to perform different rotations on adjacent qubits we will need to implement additional controls.  

One possible strategy for individually addressing these qubit levels is the shift the qubit energy spacing using a magnetic field gradient or ac Zeeman effect.  If these frequency shifts can be localized onto one ion, fields resonant with individual ions can be applied provided the transition is driven slowly enough.  With a carefully designed control system and control of the applied pulse, the fidelity of these operations can be very high.

The strategy we will be utilizing is to use optical Raman transitions.  Using Raman transitions is advantageous because the optical beams driving them can easily be focused onto individual ions, and the photons absorbed and emitted carry much more momentum and therefore couple strongly to the motion of the ions.  The interaction between optical transitions and the motional modes of the trap is still characterized by the Lamb-Dicke parameter $\eta$ = $k_\mathrm{photon} x_\mathrm{ion}$.  In order to generate entanglement between ions we need to drive two transitions that change the state of one of the traps modes of motion, so increasing our Lamb-Dicke parameter is beneficial.

The initial infrastructure for performing Raman transitions is all avilable at this point in time.  We will be using a mode-locked diode-pumped ND:YVO$_4$ laser to provide the optical beams.  This laser was originally a pump laser for our Ti:Sapphire mode-locked laser, but it has been modified to support mode-locked operation itself.  Mode-locked operation is favored by a semiconductor saturable absorber end mirror that has been added to the laser cavity.  In addition, the cavity had been modified to produce the necessary tight focus on the saturable absorber \cite{Schlatter:04, Sun:10}.  The laser produces 2~W of optical power at 1064~nm that we then frequency double using a single pass LBO crystal to 500~mW of 532~nm light.  The output pulses were measured using an autocorrelator to have 17~ps pulse times and repition rates are approximately 150~MHz.

The electric field from a mode-locked laser can be described by
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}(t) = \vec{E}_0 \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty f( t - n T ) \cos( \omega t + k x )
\end{equation}
where the function $f$ describes the pulse shape of the laser and $T$ is the time period between pulses.  In an optimal mode-locked laser $f(t) \propto \sech( \pi t / \tau )$, where $\tau$ is the time duration of the pulses.  Taking the Fourier transform of this field we can find that it has many sharp spectral components separated by the repetition rate of the laser in a range of frequencies around $\omega$.  These ``comb teeth'' can be used to drive narrow atomic transitions.

We will be using these comb teeth to drive Raman transitions between our qubit levels.  Therefore we require that the bandwidth of the laser is sufficiently larger than our qubit energy spacing that many of the comb teeth can contribute to driving transitions.  The electric field magnitude of each comb tooth $E_n$ can be found from the envelope function $f$ and the center frequency of the bandwidth of the laser.  The resulting Raman transition will have a coupling strength given by
\begin{equation}
	\Omega = \frac{ \mu^2 E_n E_{n-q} }{ \hbar \Delta }
\end{equation}
By driving Raman transitions with detunings of $\omega_\mathrm{qubit} \pm (\omega_\mathrm{motional} + \delta)$, we can use these lasers to generate entanglement between ions using the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate.  For our 532~nm light driving Raman transitions in barium, we must consider coupling through both the 6P$_{3/2}$ and the 6P$_{1/2}$ state.  I estimate that given our current laser power we can expect to drive carrier Raman transitions at a rate of $\Omega \approx$ 100~kHz.  The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen coherent two qubit operation can be driven at a rate of $2 \eta \Omega \approx$ 10~kHz.  These rates should be sufficient to demonstrate a universal set of gates in barium.  

In order to drive Raman transitions using this system we need to split the pulse train into two beams and frequency detune these beams from each other.  We have accomplished this using two AOMs.  A base 220~MHz signal is generated by an HP-8640B signal generator and then split into two paths by a rf power splitter.  One path continues directly to a high speed rf switch, while the other is mixed with a computer controlled Stanford Research Systems DS345 20~MHz signal generator and then sent to a different switch.  Both paths are then amplified by 200~MHz rf amplifers and sent to separate 200~MHz AOMs which together severely attenuate the 240~MHz mixed signal leaving the AOMs to be driven by the 200~MHz and 220~MHz signals.  The common mode 200~MHz signal has no effect on Raman transitions and so the stability only depends on the DS345 signal and there is no need to phase lock two rf sources together.  This optical setup is operational with both beams controlled by the AOMs and focused onto the trap.  The path length between the two beams is set by a linear delay stage, and the path difference has been measured to approximately overlap the two pulses temporally as well.  Since we know the separation of the Zeeman levels because we have directly driven them, there are no remaining degrees of freedom in the system.

In the future we plan to provide the rf for the two Raman beams with a two channel DDS based on the Analog Devices AD9958 part.  The two channels are controlled through a serial interface and are phase coherent because they are created from the same reference clock.  This device will also allow us to provide feedback to stabilize the frequencies of the comb teeth against path length drift in the optical cavity.  We will also be able to program pulse sequences with different amplitudes and phases into the DDS to perform error-compensating pulse sequences.

These techniques have been developed using commercial systems by several other ion trapping groups.  M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates with 10 to 100~$\mu$s $\pi$ time have been developed \cite{Hayes:10}.  The bandwidth of the modelocked laser is also sufficient to span the 12.6~GHz hyperfine splitting in ytterbium ions to drive entangling gates beteween these levels.  As we develop our ability to work with quantum information in ytterbium, this laser will become increasingly important.  In order to work with ytterbium, we can use a second double crystal to generate the third harmonic of the laser frequency at 355~nm, which is at an optimal frequency detuning for ytterbium \cite{Campbell:10}.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The initial infrastructure for working with mixed species ion chains in a quantum computer architecture has been described here and implemented in my lab.  I have developed the technology that we will use to work with surface electrode ion traps in the future.  These traps will be able to stably confine more ions in each trap and hold multiple separate trapping regions within the same vacuum chamber.  The additional voltage degrees of freedom will also allow us to control the trapping potential the ions experience within each trap.  We have demonstrated using this ability to shuttle ions around the surface trap and perform experiments in different locations to explore the local features of these traps.  Initial measurements of stray fields and heating rates have been made that will guide us in improving our cooling and trapping apparatus in the future.

We can repeatably trap barium and ytterbium ions and stably confine and cool them.  Currently the temperature of some of the modes of the ytterbium ions will be problematic for implementing entangling gates, but there are many possible avenues for overcoming this problem.  One of the main difficulties in performing these experiments at the moment, is that in the macroscopic Paul trap we are working in the ordering of the ions is random.  When we perform experiments involving the motional modes of the ions we need a particular configuration of the two species, and the only method we have to achieve this is repeatedly heating the ions until the ion crystal melts and then recrystallizing it.  As we move the techniques we have developed into surface electrode traps we should be able to perform experiments with tens of ions with full control over the number and configuration of the cooling ions.

Lastly, although most of my work has gone into the basic trapping and cooling infrastructure for our scalable system,  we have made some progress towards performing actual quantum gates using this system.  We have found and driven our Zeeman qubit level in \ba, which will enable us to rapidly set up our actual quantum operations procedures with the Vanadate laser.  All of the set up on that laser is complete and we are beginnin experiments to attempt to drive carrier transitions.  This system will allow us to begin testing how well all of the infrastructure we've developed will work during actual quantum computation.  That is an exciting step.

Overall the future for trapped ion quantum computing still looks promising.  All of the required basic systems have been implemented, and the only remaining challenge is having a sufficient number of communicating ions.  As you most certainly know by now, there are a huge number of different ways we can approach this goal.  We have been simultaneously working in several directions on this problem, and as we begin to combine these ideas into larger systems I think we'll be able to achieve some really amazing things.
