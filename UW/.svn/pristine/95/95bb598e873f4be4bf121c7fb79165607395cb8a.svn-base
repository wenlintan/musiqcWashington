Seattle is the perfect place for anyone who enjoys spending time outside and taking in some gorgeous views of mountains, oceans, and forests.  During my graduate career here I've been really enjoying spending a lot of time outside.  Although I'd never really climbed back in Indiana, since moving here I've discovered the sport.  I've been making trips almost every weekend over the past few summers out to Frenchman's Coulee, Icicle Creek, and Exit 38 outside Seattle. There's also a great sailing program through the university that I've been enjoying.  I've skippered keelboats around the lakes around Seattle as well as through the locks and out into Puget Sound.  When the weather turns, the downhill and cross country skiing can also be a lot of fun.

Frenchman's Coulee near Vantage, WA offers some really awesome and hard to believe geology in addition to interesting climbing.  Ars Technica ran an article with a lot of the details [here](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/10/the-scablands-a-scarred-landscape-as-strange-as-fiction/), but basically the valleys and coulees in the areaformed violently when a huge lake in Montana overran its shores and flooded out to the Pacific.  The water revealed numerous hexagonal columns of basalt that were formed volcanically before that.  The columns offer some really unique climbing with lots of pockets dug in them and many aretes that can be scaled.  I think my favorite routes here have been _Ride 'Em Cowboy_ and _Choss Master_.  One of the most fun parts about climbing here is how tall a lot of the routes are.  We've climbed several routes that are 30-35m.

Icicle Creek near Leavenworth, WA is a regular old river valley, but its filled with glacial erratics and granite bluffs.  Both sides of the canyon have beautiful hiking and climbing.  Instead of deeply pocketed and flaky rock, most of the climbing at Icicle involves using hand and fist sized cracks in granite.  There's a lot more traditional routes here than sport, but a good number can also be top roped.  I've just recently received the start of my trad rack and tried leading my first few trad routes here.  Unfortunately, a lot of the classic routes here require a lot of trad gear and experience climbing multi-pitch routes, which no one in my usual climbing group really has yet.

The bouldering in the area is also lots of fun.  The floor of the canyon has a lot of small house size glacial erratics that often have multiple bouldering routes up their sides.  There's even some pretty fun hueco routes in some places.  We've done a bit of bouldering use crash pads from the university climbing club, but mostly have been practicing crack climbing on top rope so far.

Exit 38 is less than half an hour from Seattle, and has a really fun mix of different styles of climbing available.  I think we've climbing just about everything 5.10- and below at exit 38 at this point, but we keep coming back to reclimb old favorites and try to break into the upper 5.10s.  I think the 5.10s at the Gun Show wall are some of my favorites here, but the 5.9s on Write Off Rock are also a lot of fun.

The University of Washington has a great sailing club for beginning and intermediate sailors.  For a reasonable fee, students and alumni can rent any of the clubs boats that they know how to sail and receive free instruction on any of the others.  I've been lucky enough to get certified to sail the clubs fleet of 28-32ft keelboats through all of the connected waterways around Seattle including the sound.  Taking weekend trips over to Kingston and Poulsbo has been a lot of fun, whenever we can make it out for the whole weekend.  In addition the club has a fleet of Hobie 16s that are my favorite boats for cruising around the bays and Lake Washington.

The weather does inevitably turn to rain down here in Seattle, but luckily most of that falls as snow in the mountains.  The skiing up at Snoqualmie isn't the best, but it's less than an hour drive away.  Close enough that you can even drive up there after work on the weekdays occasionally.  There's also some fun cross country skiing in the foothills on this side of the mountains.
