650: .31121 (.313190 on lock program)
	drifted down to .313165 during .714460 scan for a bit
	was at .313200 during .714440, .714460 scan
	holding well betwen .313180 and .313205 on lock program for rest of data
		it does look like there is some change in flourescence over this range ...

During last runs 3500 and 4000ms WM frequency started drifting lower, but ion flourescence stayed the same
so I tried to follow ion flourescences.  WM read as low as .714435
