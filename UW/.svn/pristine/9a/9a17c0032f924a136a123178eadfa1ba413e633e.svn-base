Mixed species chains of barium and ytterbium ions are investigated as a tool for building scalable quantum computation devices.  Ytterbium ions provide a stable environmentally-insensitive qubit that is easily initialized and manipulated, while barium ions are easily entangled with photons that can allow quantum information to be shared between systems in multiple quantum computation units.  Barium and ytterbium are trapped in a linear chain in a Paul trap and their normal mode structure and thermal occupation numbers are measured with a narrow fiber laser addressing a quadrupole transition to evaluate the suitability of the scheme. Planar surface traps with many DC electrodes provide the ability to reorder the chain of ions to optimize normal mode cooling, and initial attempts to realize this capability are discussed.  Transferring quantum information between ions in the chain requires lasers with large Lamb-Dicke parameters to provide good coupling to the motional degrees of freedom of the chain.  For this reason, a mode-locked Raman system is developed and initial measurements of qubit rotations are shown.
