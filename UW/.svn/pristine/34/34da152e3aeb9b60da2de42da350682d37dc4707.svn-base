abstract = {We report on the demonstration of ion-photon entanglement and Bell inequality violation in a system of trapped Ba138$+$ ions. Entanglement between the Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of a single Ba138$+$ ion and the polarization state of a single 493\&\#xA0;nm photon emitted by the ion with a fidelity of 0.84\&\#xB1;0.01 was achieved, along with a Bell signal of 2.3, exceeding the classical limit of 2 by more than eight standard deviations. This system is a promising candidate for a loophole-free Bell inequality violation test using long-range ion\&\#x2013;ion entanglement as the wavelengths of the transitions of Ba138$+$ are in the visible region and thus suitable for long-range transmission over fiber optic cable.},

abstract = {Trapped, laser-cooled atoms and ions produce intense fluorescence of the order 107~108 photons per second. Detection of this fluorescence enables efficient measurement of the quantum state of qubits based on trapped atoms. It is desirable to collect a large fraction of the photons to make the detection faster and more reliable. Additionally, efficient fluorescence collection can improve the speed and fidelity of remote ion entanglement and quantum gates. Refractive and reflective optics, and optical cavities have all been used to collect the trapped ion fluorescence with up to about 10\% efficiency. Here we show a novel ion trap design that incorporates a metallic spherical mirror as the integral part of the trap itself, being its RF electrode. The mirror geometry enables up to 35\% solid angle collection of trapped ion fluorescence. The movable central pin electrode of this trap allows precise placement of the ion at the focus of the reflector. We characterize the performance of the mirror, and measure 25\% collection efficiency, likely limited by the imperfections of the mirror surface. We also study the properties of the images of single ions formed by the spherical mirror and apply aberration correction with an aspherical element placed outside the vacuum system. Owing to the simplicity of its design, this trap structure can be adapted for microfabrication and integration into more complex trap architectures.},

	abstract ={The performance of superconducting qubits has improved by several orders of magnitude in the past decade. These circuits benefit from the robustness of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, and at present they have not encountered any hard physical limits. However, building an error-corrected information processor with many such qubits will require solving specific architecture problems that constitute a new field of research. For the first time, physicists will have to master quantum error correction to design and operate complex active systems that are dissipative in nature, yet remain coherent indefinitely. We offer a view on some directions for the field and speculate on its future.},

We report on a remarkable evolution of the field, where decoherence—one of the main challenges for realizing quantum computers—no longer seems to be the stumbling block it had originally been considered. General concepts, relevant quantities, and basic requirements for spin-based quantum computing are explained; opportunities and challenges of spin-orbit interaction and nuclear spins are reviewed. We discuss recent achievements, present current theoretical proposals, and make several suggestions for further experiments. }

	abstract ={Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped 171Yb+ atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.},

Trapping times exceeding 20 min without laser cooling, and heating rates as low as 0.8 quanta ms -1 , indicate stable trapping conditions in these microtraps. A coherence time of more than 1 s, high fidelity qubit state detection and single qubit rotations are demonstrated. The observation of low heating rates and demonstration of high quality single qubit gates at room temperature are critical steps toward scalable quantum information processing in microfabricated surface traps.}

  abstract={We present the design, fabrication and experimental implementation of surface ion traps with Y-shaped junctions. The traps are designed to minimize the pseudopotential variations in the junction region at the symmetric intersection of three linear segments. We experimentally demonstrate robust linear and junction shuttling with greater than 10 6 round-trip shuttles without ion loss. By minimizing the direct line of sight between trapped ions and dielectric surfaces, negligible day-to-day and trap-to-trap variations are observed. In addition to high-fidelity single-ion shuttling, multiple-ion chains survive splitting, ion-position swapping and recombining routines. The development of two-dimensional trapping structures is an important milestone for ion-trap quantum computing and quantum simulations.}

  abstract={We report the design, fabrication and characterization of a microfabricated surface-electrode ion trap that supports controlled transport through the two-dimensional intersection of linear trapping zones arranged in a 90° cross. The trap is fabricated with very large scalable integration techniques which are compatible with scaling to a large quantum information processor. The shape of the radio-frequency electrodes is optimized with a genetic algorithm to reduce axial pseudopotential barriers and minimize ion heating during transport. Seventy-eight independent dc control electrodes enable fine control of the trapping potentials. We demonstrate reliable ion transport between junction legs and determine the rate of ion loss due to transport. Doppler-cooled ions survive more than 10 5 round-trip transits between junction legs without loss and more than 65 consecutive round trips without laser cooling.}

  abstract={We report heating rate measurements in a microfabricated gold-on-sapphire surface electrode ion trap with a trapping height of approximately 240 μm. Using the Doppler recooling method, we characterize the trap heating rates over an extended region of the trap. The noise spectral density of the trap falls in the range of noise spectra reported in ion traps at room temperature. We find that during the first months of operation, the heating rates increase by approximately one order of magnitude. The increase in heating rates is largest in the ion-loading region of the trap, providing a strong hint that surface contamination plays a major role for excessive heating rates. We discuss data found in the literature and the possible relation of anomalous heating to sources of noise and dissipation in other systems, namely impurity atoms adsorbed onto metal surfaces and amorphous dielectrics.}

	abstract={Trapped ions are pre-eminent candidates for building quantum information processors and quantum simulators. To scale such systems to more than a few tens of ions it is important to tackle the observed high ion-heating rates and create scalable trap structures which can be simply and reliably produced. Here, we report on cryogenically operated intrinsic-silicon ion traps which can be rapidly and easily fabricated using standard semiconductor technologies. Single 40 Ca + ions have been trapped and used to characterize the trap operation. Long ion lifetimes were observed with the traps exhibiting heating rates as low as ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/16/11/113068/njp504196ieqn1.gif] {$\mathop{{\bar{n}}}\limits^{.}\;=\;$} 0.33 phonons s −1 at an ion-electrode distance of 230 μm.

We show theoretically and experimentally how the damping of the relaxation oscillations is reduced and finally becomes zero when the pump power is reduced so that the threshold for Q-switched mode locking is approached. For the first time to our knowledge, this method provides important information on the stability of mode locking above the Q-switched mode-locking threshold. It is applicable to lasers that are mode locked with slow-saturable absorbers. The results helped to explain the cause of unexpectedly low Q-switching thresholds in two cases. Also we obtain some useful spectroscopic information.},
