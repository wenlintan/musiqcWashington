As we make progress towards effectively cooling these ion chains we want to begin exploring how effective quantum operations can be engineered in ions in them.  We have begun performing single qubit quantum gates with barium ions in our system, and are preparing the necessary equipment to being characterizing entangling gates.  Although these single qubit rotations are simplistic we will soon be able to start using them to explore quantum coherence in this system.

\section{Zeeman Transitions}
\label{sec:zeeman}

The Zeeman qubit I have described in barium as well as the hyperfine qubit in ytterbium have large magnetic moments.  Coherent control of these qubits can be implemented using oscillating magnetic fields.  In our group we have some traps that have been designed to accomodate applying large magnetic fields to ions by placing good conductors along paths inside of the vacuum chamber near the ion.  Our quantum information vacuum chambers were not designed to incorporate this feature, and for the moment we are applying the fields from outside them.

We have demonstrated our ability to find and drive Zeeman transitions using an external field coil driven by a Stanford SRS-345 frequency source.  The field coil is composed of approximately 20 turns of copper wire and is located on our imaging viewport as close to the ion as possible.  The rf can be crudely coupled onto this coil by making a basic resonant circuit by adding capacitance to cancel the coil's inductance near the Zeeman transition frequency.

The experimental procedure to observe these transitions again begins by switching the cooling lasers to perform optical pumping and pumping the ion into one of the Zeeman states, which I will call $\ket{0}$.  The cooling lasers are then shuttered and we attempt to drive a Zeeman transition at our Zeeman transition frequency $\omega$ = 14.610~MHz.  After this attempt we apply a $\pi$-pulse of 1762~nm light the drive $\ket{0}$ to some Zeeman level in the 5D$_{5/2}$ state of barium with a probability of approximately 90\%.  Finally, we reactivate the cooling lasers and the ion flouresces if it has not been successfully shelved into the 5D$_{5/2}$ state.

For our initial characterization of this process, we have only been able to apply relatively small magnetic fields to the ion.  Figure~\ref{fig:zeeman-rabi} shows the shelving probabilty as a function of the exposure time of our rf source tuned to resonate with the Zeeman transition.  The beginning of a Rabi oscillation is clear, but then the frequency and amplitude of the transition begin to change.  These changes are due to the changing magnetic field in the trap because of the ac wall phase.  All of our magnetically sensitive experiments are triggered to begin on a maximum of the ac wall voltage, but since this experiment lasts for several milliseconds we begin to see the magnetic field shift.

The fidelity of this qubit operation is currently low, but it demonstrates that we have the infrastructure to support these kinds of operations.  The fidelity could be quickly improved by using amplifiers and resonators to apply a stronger magnetic field to the ion.  Increasing our magnetic field would allow us to minimize the size of the magnetic field drift.  Our maximum shelving probability could also be signifcantly improved by carefully improving our optical pumping efficiency and Doppler cooling efficiency.  In actual quantum information processing it will be more important to improve the fidelity of the qubit rotation operations because many of these operations must be performed before a single measurement in a quantum operation.  The accumulation of errors in qubit operations over the course of algorithms is going to be one of the next challenging problems to address in trapped ion quantum computing.

\section{Raman Transitions}
\label{sec:raman-trans}

The difficulty with this kind of performing qubit rotations using this direct technique is that the energy separation between ideal qubit levels can often be very small.  Therefore, near resonant radiation will have a long wavelength and be difficult to address onto single ions.  For example, the qubit we will address in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ has an energy splitting of approximatel 12~GHz, which corresponds to radiation with a wavelength of approximately 2.5~cm.  Typical ion separations in a single trapping region are 5~um to 10~um.  For performing quantum algorithms where we need to perform different rotations on adjacent qubits we will need to implement additional controls.  

One possible strategy for individually addressing these qubit levels is the shift the qubit energy spacing using a magnetic field gradient or ac Zeeman effect.  If these frequency shifts can be localized onto one ion, fields resonant with individual ions can be applied provided the transition is driven slowly enough

The strategy we will be utilizing is to use optical Raman transitions.  Using Raman transitions is advantageous because the optical beams driving them can easily be focused onto individual ions, and the photons absorbed and emitted carry much more momentum and therefore couple more strong to the motion of the ions.  The interaction between optical transitions and the motional modes of the trap is still characterized by the Lamb-Dicke parameter $\eta$ = $k_\mathrm{photon} x_\mathrm{ion}$.  In order to generate entanglement between ions we need to drive two transitions that change the state of one of the traps modes of motion, so increasing our Lamb-Dicke parameter is beneficial.

The initial infrastructure for performing Raman transitions is all avilable at this point in time.  We will be using a mode-locked diode-pumped ND:YVO4 laser to provide the optical beams.  This laser was originally a pump laser for our Ti:Sapphire mode-locked laser, but has been modified to 

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The initial infrastructure for working with mixed species ion chains in a quantum computer architecture has been described here and implemented in my lab.  We can repeatably trap barium and ytterbium ions and stably confine and cool them.  Currently the temperature of some of the modes of the ytterbium ions will be problematic for implemen

Overall the future for trapped ion quantum computing still looks promising.  All of the required basic systems have been implemented.
